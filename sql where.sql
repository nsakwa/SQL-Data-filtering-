--The WHERE clause in SQL serves as a query for filtering data in a database table. It defines --specific conditions that rows must satisfy to be included in the results of a query.Here is a simple:

SELECT * FROM computer science WHERE programming = 'JavaScript';

--This query will fetch all rows from the computer science table where the programming column contains the value 'Javascript'.

--Important aspects of the WHERE clause:

-- It supports comparison operators such as =, <, >, <=, >=, and <> (not equal).
-- It allows for the use of logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT to combine various conditions.
-- It can incorporate wildcards like % (representing any number of characters) and _ (representing a single character) for pattern matching.

-- By using the WHERE clause, you can pinpoint the specific data you require from your database.
